I wonder how sshfs manages stable inodes that differ from the actual ones?
But if it's really reliably stable, it would be ok to use it with the
directory special remote.

Extending the external special remote interface to support
[import](https://git-annex.branchable.com/design/external_special_remote_protocol/export_and_import_appendix/#index1h2)
would let you roll your own special remote, that could use ssh with
rsync or whatever. 

The current design for that tries to support both import and export, but
noone has yet stepped up to the plate to try to implement a special remote
that supports both safely. So I am leaning toward thinking that it would be
a good idea to make the external special remote interface support *only*
import (or export) for a given external special remote, but not both.

Then would become pretty easy to make your own special remote that
implements import only. Using whatever ssh commands make sense for the
server.
