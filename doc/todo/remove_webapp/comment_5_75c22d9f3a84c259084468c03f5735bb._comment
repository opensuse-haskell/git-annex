I've copied the `git-annex activity` idea over to
[[todo/Recent_remote_activities]] so it doesn't get lost.

I don't think it makes sense to make that a blocker for removing the webapp
though. That would only let an advanced user build some kind of activity
display, doesn't address the needs of most users of the webapp.
