It would be possible to make `git-annex testremote` support the
command-line options of the underlying test framework (tasty).
`git-annex test` already does that, so has --list-test and --pattern.

It's not as simple as just plumbing that up though, because testremote has
implicit dependencies in its test ordering. It has to do the `storeKey`
test before it can do the `present` test, for example. Those dependencies
would need to be made explict, rather than implicit.

Explict dependencies, though, would also make it not really possible to run
most of the tests separately. Running testremote 5 times to run the listed
tests, if each run does the necessary `storeKey` would add a lot of overhead.

Not declaring dependencies and leaving it up to the user to run testremote
repeatedly to run a sequence of tests in the necessary order would also
run into problems with testremote using random test keys which change every
time it's run, as well as it having an end cleanup stage where it removes
any lingering test keys from the local repository and the remote.

This seems to be a bit of an impasse... :-/
