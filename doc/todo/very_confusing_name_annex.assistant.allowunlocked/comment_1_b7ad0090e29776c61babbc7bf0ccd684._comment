I think that "annex.assistant.allowlocked" would be as confusing, like you
say the user would then have to RTFM to realize that they need to use
annex.addunlocked to configure it, and that it doesn't cause files to be
locked by default.

To me, "treataddunlocked" is vague. Treat it as what?
"allowaddunlocked" would be less vague since it does get the (full)
name of the other config in there, so says it's allowing use of
the other config.

I agree this is a confusing name, and I wouldn't mind changing it, but I
don't think it warrants an entire release to do that. So there would be
perhaps a month for people to start using the current name. If this had
come up in the 2 weeks between implementation and release I would have
changed it, but at this point it starts to need a backwards compatability
transition to change it, and I don't know if the minor improvement of
"allowaddunlocked" is worth that.
