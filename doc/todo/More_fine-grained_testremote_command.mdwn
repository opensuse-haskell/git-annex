I am using `git annex testremote` as a baseline test bench for Forgejo-aneksajo as a git-annex remote, and it is awesome to have that. I have some pain points with it though:

- I would like to use these tests to confirm that I don't accidentally give write access to read-only users. This means I would need a way to ensure that all tests which require write access fail against the remote.
- I am spawning a `git annex testremote` subprocess within the integration tests of Forgejo-aneksajo, which are written in Go. Sometimes this "large blackbox test" gets stuck in CI and I haven't figured out why yet. It would be nice to have a more transparent integration into the Forgejo-aneksajo test suite.

Both of those points could be addressed if `git annex testremote` provided a way to run each test individually, and to get a list of all the available tests categorized by if they are read-only or read-write. I could then integrate each as an individual sub-test into Forgejo-aneksajo's test suite and properly assert on the outcome of the test given the respective test setup.

If that's not possible for some reason it would also be an improvement with regards to the first point if there was something like a `git annex testremote --write-only` with the option to only report success if all of those tests have failed.

What do you think?
