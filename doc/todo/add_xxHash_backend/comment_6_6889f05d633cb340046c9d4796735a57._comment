I am inclined to keep this todo open despite external backend
programs existing, because it would be nice to have xxHash in
git-annex natively due to its speed.

I found this haskell library which includes xxh3
and which would be easy to add as a git-annex dependency,
although it would need to be gated behind a build flag for now:
<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xxhash-ffi>

(Since that library uses Hashable, it generates an Int for the hash.
This seems to limit it to be used on 64 bit platforms. 
<https://github.com/haskell-haskey/xxhash-ffi/issues/6>
The lower-level Data.Digest.XXHash.FFI.C uses CULLong so will work on 32
bit.)
