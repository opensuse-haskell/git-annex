A `git-annex activity` (or `git-annex log`) could also optionally stream live
activity as it is happening. Eg, when a transfer is started it could display
the start, and then later the end. That would be easy to build with what's
in git-annex already. The assistant already uses the transfer logs that way,
using inotify to notice changes.
