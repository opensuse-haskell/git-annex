This is essentially the same as `git-annex log` with a path. It also
supports --since and --json. The difference I guess is the idea to also
include information about git commits of the files, not only git-annex
location changes. That would complicate the output, and apparently
`git-annex log`'s output is too hard to parse already. So a design for a
better output would be needed.

This is the same as `git-annex log --all` with the output filtered to only
list a given remote. (`--in` does not influence `--all` currently).

Can probably be accomplished with `git log` with some
-S regexp.
