Copying a related idea from @nobodyinperson on [[todo/remove_webapp]]:

Furthermore, a command like `git annex activity` that goes arbitrarily far back in time and statically (non-live) lists recent activities like:

- yesterday 23:32: remote1 downloaded 5 files (45MB)
- today 10:45: you modified file `document.txt` (10MB)
- today 10:46: you uploaded file `document.txt` (from today 10:45) to remote1, remote2 and remote3
- today 12:35: Fred McGitFace modified file `document.txt` (12MB) and uploaded to remote2
- ...

Basically a human-readable (or as JSON), chronological log of things that happened in the repo. This is a superpower of git-annex: all this information is available as far back as one wants, we just don't have a way to access it nicely. `git log` and `git annex log` exist, but they are too specific, too broad or a bit hard to parse on their own. For example:

- `git annex activity --since=\"2 weeks ago\" --include='*.doc'` would list things (who committed, which remote received it, etc.) that happened in the last two weeks to *.doc files
- `git annex activity --only-annex --in=remote2` would list recent annex operations (in the `git-annex` branch only) of remote2
- `git annex activity --only-changes --largerthan=10MB` would list recent file changes (additions, modifications, deletions, etc., in `git log` only)

This `git annex assistant-log` and `git annex activity` would be a very nice feature to showcase git-annex's power (which other file syncing tool can to this? ðŸ¤”) and also solve [[todo/Recent_remote_activities]].
