### Please describe the problem.

Since upgrading to git-annex version 10.20250925, from the macOS HomeBrew build, `git annex importfeed` seems to *usually* fail with an `Enum.toEnum{Word8}` out of bounds error.  The exact value reported for the out of bounds value varies between feed URLs, but from a little bit of testing the error appears deterministic between those feed URLs.

A few examples (plus one more in the reproducer below):

```
importfeed https://popculturedetective.agency/feed/podcast 
git-annex: Enum.toEnum{Word8}: tag (8217) is outside of bounds (0,255)
failed
```

```
importfeed https://contextualelectronics.com/feed/podcast/ 
git-annex: Enum.toEnum{Word8}: tag (8217) is outside of bounds (0,255)
failed
```

```
importfeed https://theamphour.libsyn.com/rss 
git-annex: Enum.toEnum{Word8}: tag (8211) is outside of bounds (0,255)
failed
```

(A couple of podcast feeds with no new changes just report "ok"; but I'd also expect most of the above to not have any recent changes as they're weekly-or-less podcasts.)

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Indicative example (one of the feed URLs I follow; but it's happening on all of *most* of them that all worked with the previous version of git-annex):

```
ewen@basadi:/tmp/podcasts$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /private/tmp/podcasts/.git/
ewen@basadi:/tmp/podcasts$ git annex init 'Test repo'
init Test repo ok
(recording state in git...)
ewen@basadi:/tmp/podcasts$ TEMPLATE='archive/${feedtitle}/${itemtitle}${extension}'
ewen@basadi:/tmp/podcasts$ git annex importfeed --template="${TEMPLATE}" "https://risky.biz/feeds/risky-business"
importfeed gathering known urls ok
importfeed https://risky.biz/feeds/risky-business 
git-annex: Enum.toEnum{Word8}: tag (8217) is outside of bounds (0,255)
failed
importfeed: 1 failed
ewen@basadi:/tmp/podcasts$ 
```

The `--template` part does not seem necessary to the reproducer either, as I get the same error without (it's just the `--template` is in my standard run that I've used for years):

```
ewen@basadi:/tmp/podcasts$ git annex importfeed "https://risky.biz/feeds/risky-business"
importfeed gathering known urls ok
importfeed https://risky.biz/feeds/risky-business 
git-annex: Enum.toEnum{Word8}: tag (8217) is outside of bounds (0,255)
failed
importfeed: 1 failed
ewen@basadi:/tmp/podcasts$ 
```

on macOS 15.6.1 (Sequoia), which is the latest release apart from the macOS 26 released this month.  On Intel in this case, but seems to also reproduce on the same macOS 15.6.1 (Sequoia) on Apple M2 processor, with the same HomeBrew build of git-annex.

### Please provide any additional information below.

At this stage I don't know if this is specific to `importfeed` or specific to the HomeBrew build of git-annex.

Other annexes tracking files do seem to work (`git annex add` / `git annex sync` / `git annex copy ...` all work) with this version of git-annex.  So I suspect it's somehow specific to importfeed and/or the HomeBrew build.

And it seems a fairly recent breakage, as IIRC the previous installed was from 2025-08.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes, for many years.  git-annex has worked vey well for downloading/collecting podcasts for years, which is why t was surprising it's suddenly failing like this.
