Yay!

OsPath needs the os-string and file-io haskell packages. Which are not
currently in Debian. So either work will need to be done to package those,
or when Debian upgrades ghc to 9.12.2, it will include those libraries
automatically since they are bundled with ghc since that version.

Maybe you know more than I do about the state of Debian's haskell support.

The transition is being tracked at [[todo/RawFilePath_conversion]] but I
don't know yet what the solution is to getting the dependencies broadly
available.

(Or I could implement the same fixes when not built with that flag of
course. It is doable. Just annoying especially since that code will have to
be carefully gotten just right, only to be thrown away later.)
