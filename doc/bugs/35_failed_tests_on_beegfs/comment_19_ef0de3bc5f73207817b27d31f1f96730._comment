Confirmed in your log that git-annex is not built with the
OsPath build flag, so it will still not be using `O_CLOEXEC`.

It would be good to get a build with OsPath and test it to see if my fixes
actually did work. Debian doesn't include the necessary library yet, so a
build using stack is needed.
