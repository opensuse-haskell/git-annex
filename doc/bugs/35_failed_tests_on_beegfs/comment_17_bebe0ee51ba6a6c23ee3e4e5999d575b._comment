Drat. Reopened bug.

Is the error for these still "export.ex [...] Device or resource busy"?

If so, the problem must not be beegfs not liking an open file to be
renamed, but something else. 

I have verified that the temp file that gets renamed to the "export.ex"
log file is now opened with `O_CLOEXEC`.
