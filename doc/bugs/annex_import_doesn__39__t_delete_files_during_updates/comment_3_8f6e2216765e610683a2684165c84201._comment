Another way to think about this problem is that git-annex export does not
update the remote tracking branch. If it did, there would be no need for
git-annex import to learn about changes made by export, and its current
diffing behavior would be ok.

However, since one repository can export to a special remote, and a
different repository import from the same special remote, updating the
tracking branch would need to happen later, based on information the export
records in the git-annex branch.

Which is something that git-annex import could do. But it might not be any
more efficient to do that than a non-diff based update.
