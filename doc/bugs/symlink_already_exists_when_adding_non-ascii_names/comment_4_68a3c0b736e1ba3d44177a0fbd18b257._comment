There was another bug filed about the same problem, 
[[bugs/git-annex_add__47__unlock_fails_for_some_names]].

Cause is a filename that is 21 bytes long and begins with a utf-8
character. Which AFAICS all the filenames mentioned here are.

[[!commit 67f00027d1b326c979db8b81c973a61234c406d7]] fixes this.
