### Please describe the problem.

The standalone build is missing an entrypoint script for git-remote-p2p-annex. There is only the binary in bin/git-remote-p2p-annex, but that is missing the setup work for the environment that the other scripts in the top-level directory do.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Try to use git-remote-p2p-annex from the latest standalone build.


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

10.20250828-gfe7ecf505146342fe8df2430a0bcaf5f02d89a80


### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.
"""]]

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
