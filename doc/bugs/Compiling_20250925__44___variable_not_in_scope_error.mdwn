I'm attempting to update Arch Linux packaging ... the major caveat being we're stuck using an old (9.4.8) version of `ghc` for now...

Building the latest tagged release now produces this error:

```
Utility/OpenFd.hs:28:9: error:
    Variable not in scope: when :: Bool -> IO () -> IO a0
   |
28 |         when closeonexec $
   |         ^^^^
```

I'm not sure this error is directly caused by the antiquated compiler, but also not sure how to debug this further or work around it either.
