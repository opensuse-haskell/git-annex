git-annex is still targeting supporting ghc back to 9.0.2, so your old
ghc should not yet be a problem. However, I don't have any CI left that
uses such old versions of ghc, so it might break from time to time.

I've fixed this one, which was a missing `import Control.Monad`. Please
report if you find other build failures.
