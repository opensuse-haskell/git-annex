git-annex has a dependency on unbounded-delays, listed in git-annex.cabal.

Noting has changed here since 2024 when it stopped vendoring part of that
library and added the dependency.

I do see that the debian/control shipped with git-annex was missing that
dep, I've added it and I *guess* that will fix your problem
