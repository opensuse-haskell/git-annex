Thanks for the very quick turn around on a new release!

Conveniently HomeBrew also turned around building the new release quickly (I suspect it might be one of the packages in their CI for auto upgrade now), so I've been able to test the HomeBrew build of 20050929.

20250929 seems to be working correctly to download podcast feeds, parse them, and download the media attachments as before.

PS: Test example below.  But also worked for my regular podcast downloads, which were failing with 20250926.

```
