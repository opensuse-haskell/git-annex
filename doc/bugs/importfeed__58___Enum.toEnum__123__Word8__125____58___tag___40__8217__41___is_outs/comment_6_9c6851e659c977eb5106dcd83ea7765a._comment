Thanks for some really good detective work @ewen.

Note that this only happens when git-annex is built with the OsPath build
flag. 

That seems to indicate that the problem is in
Utility.FileIO.openBinaryFile,
which is the only way that parseFeedFromFile' varies depending on that
build flag.

Aha yes, the problem is that uses withOpenFileEncoding, which is
inappropriate for a binary file!
