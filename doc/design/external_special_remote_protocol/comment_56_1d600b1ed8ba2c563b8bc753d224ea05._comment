@psxvoid that's fundamentally different than how git-annex works, so there
will need to be some kind of translation layer. And I think you could put
it in your special remote.

For example, you could store both the archive file, as well as annex object
files that have not yet made it into the archive. So that when git-annex
sends a file to your remote, the file is actually stored in the remote,
rather than in a temporary location. Then you could periodically make a
new archive file from the loose objects.
