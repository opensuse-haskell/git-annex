I set up `annex.largefiles` in my global `.gitattributes` config. But git add doesn't add the defined large files to annex. But git annex works with large and small files as intended.

My config is the one below:

```
* annex.largefiles=nothing
*.pdf annex.largefiles=anything
*.mp4 annex.largefiles=anything
*.mp3 annex.largefiles=anything
*.mkv annex.largefiles=anything
*.odt annex.largefiles=anything
*.wav annex.largefiles=anything
*.DOC annex.largefiles=anything
*.pptx annex.largefiles=anything
*.docx annex.largefiles=anything
```
