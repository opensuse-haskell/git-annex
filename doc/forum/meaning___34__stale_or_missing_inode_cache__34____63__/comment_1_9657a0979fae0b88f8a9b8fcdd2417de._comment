The inode cache is something git-annex uses internally to keep track of
changes to files. There are some known situations where it can get out of
date, including an upgrade from a v8 repository. Sometimes inodes change
for various reasons, like copying a repository from one filesystem to
another. So this just means that fsck has detected and updated the
information. I would not worry about it unless git-annex has other
unexpected behavior.
