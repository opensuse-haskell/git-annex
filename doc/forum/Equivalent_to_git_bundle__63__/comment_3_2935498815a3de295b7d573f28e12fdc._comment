I'm also interested in this feature, because I'd got git annex repo corrupted a couple of times due to a power loss.

But it's not clear enough yet how it's supposed to work. Should it create an archive containing a git-bundle + annexed files containing ONLY files in this bundle commit range?

It might be possible to write a script that does exactly that, but having something integrated into git-annex itself could be a bonus with cross-platform support (available on both windows and linux), standardized and ready for archival (e.g. bundles can be written periodically onto m-discs).

I'm also wondering what if a current repository get corrupted (at least partially), will git annex be able to \"restore\" it's state after git-bundle-restore?
