    fsck: 5 failed


Shouldn't this be automatically resolved by git annex assistant?

I have three repositories in groups archive and backup. These five failes are on/in neither of the three.

`git annex copy --auto --to ONE_OF_THE_ARCHIVE_BACKUP_REPOSITORIES` does not solve the problem.

Just manually copying them to other repositories solved it.

What did I miss or did not understand? Git assistant runs on all repositories and are ssh connected nearly 24/7 and all other syncing works fine.
